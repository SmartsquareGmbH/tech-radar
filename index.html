            <h3>What is the Tech Radar?</h3>

            <p>
                The Smartsquare Tech Radar, based on the
                <a href="https://opensource.zalando.com/tech-radar/">Zalando Tech Radar</a>, is a list of technologies,
                complemented by an assessment result, called <em>ring assignment</em>. We use four rings with the
                following semantics:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>ADOPT</strong> &mdash; Technologies we have high confidence in to serve our purpose, also in
                    large scale. Technologies with a usage culture in our production environment, low risk and
                    recommended to be widely used.
                </li>
                <li><strong>TRIAL</strong> &mdash; Technologies that we have seen work with success in project work to
                    solve a real problem; first serious usage experience that confirm benefits and can uncover
                    limitations. TRIAL technologies are slightly more risky; some engineers in our organization walked
                    this path and will share knowledge and experiences.
                </li>
                <li><strong>ASSESS</strong> &mdash; Technologies that are promising and have clear potential value-add
                    for us; technologies worth to invest some research and prototyping efforts in to see if it has
                    impact. ASSESS technologies have higher risks; they are often brand new and highly unproven in our
                    organisation. You will find some engineers that have knowledge in the technology and promote it, you
                    may even find teams that have started a prototyping effort.
                </li>
                <li><strong>HOLD</strong> &mdash; Technologies not recommended to be used for new projects. Technologies
                    that we think are not (yet) worth to (further) invest in. HOLD technologies should not be used for
                    new projects, but usually can be continued for existing projects.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What is the purpose?</h3>

            <p>
                The Tech Radar is a tool to inspire and support the engineers at Smartsquare and the open-source
                community to pick the best technologies for new projects. It provides a platform to share knowledge
                and experiences in technologies, to reflect on technology decisions and continuously evolve our
                technology landscape. This radar is based on the work of
                <a href="https://opensource.zalando.com/">Zalando</a> and
                <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar">ThoughtWorks</a>.
