          <h3>What is the Tech Radar?</h3>

          <p>
            The Smartsquare Tech Radar, based on the
            <a href="https://opensource.zalando.com/tech-radar/">Zalando Tech Radar</a>, is a list of technologies,
            complemented by an assessment result, called <em>ring assignment</em>. We use four rings with the following
            semantics:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>ADOPT</strong> &mdash; Technologies we have high confidence in to serve our purpose, also in large
              scale. Technologies with a usage culture in our production environment, low risk and recommended to be
              widely used but need to fit the use case as well as the requirements.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>TRIAL</strong> &mdash; Technologies that we have seen work with success in project work to solve a
              real problem; first serious usage experience that confirm benefits and can uncover limitations. TRIAL
              technologies are slightly more risky; some engineers in our organization walked this path and will share
              knowledge and experiences.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>ASSESS</strong> &mdash; Technologies that are promising and have clear potential value-add for us;
              technologies worth to invest some research and prototyping efforts in to see if it has impact. ASSESS
              technologies have higher risks; they are often brand new and highly unproven in our organisation. You will
              find some engineers that have knowledge in the technology and promote it, you may even find teams that
              have started a prototyping effort.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>HOLD</strong> &mdash; Technologies not recommended to be used for new projects. Technologies that
              we think are not (yet) worth to (further) invest in. HOLD technologies should not be used for new
              projects, but usually can be continued for existing projects.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>What is the purpose?</h3>

          <p>
            The Tech Radar is a tool to inspire and support the engineers at Smartsquare and the open-source community
            to pick the best technologies for new projects. It provides a platform to share knowledge and experiences in
            technologies, to reflect on technology decisions and continuously evolve our technology landscape. This
            radar is based on the work of
            <a href="https://opensource.zalando.com/">Zalando</a> and
            <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar">ThoughtWorks</a>.
